# Stock Hunter
A stock searching website for CSC Hacks 2021.

## Project Description
We want to create a website that allows users to search for stocks using a variety of criteria. Example queries include highest performers in a certain timeframe, trading volume, moving averages, industries, etc.

Our frontend will be implemented in React. Our backend technologies are still being decided. We will likely use a web API for retrieving stock data.
